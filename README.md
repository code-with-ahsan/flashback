## About the game
This is a memory based game built for the MongoDB Atlas Hackathon. Players can create game lobbies and invite others using a link. They can simulataneously play the memory game and whoever finishes first, essentially wins and the game quickly ends as someone finishes the game as a winner.


## Built with
The game is built using Angular, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, NestJS, MongoDB 😄 (of course), and Firebase. Also, with a lot of and hardwork 💗. Which can be seen at either [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/codewithahsan) or [YouTube](https://youtube.com/CodeWithAhsan) as all of this was streamed LIVE with all my efforts, frustration, and small wins 😉.

## Where is everything hosted?
The frontend of the app is deployed to Firebase Hosting while the backend (NestJS) is deployed to Heroku.
